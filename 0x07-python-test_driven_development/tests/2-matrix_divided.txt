# Test Cases for matrix_divided function

# Test Case 1
# Divide a matrix by 2
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]]

# Test Case 2
# Divide a matrix by 0 (should raise a ZeroDivisionError)
>>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Test Case 3
# Divide a non-matrix input (should raise a TypeError)
>>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Test Case 4
# Divide a matrix with rows of different sizes (should raise a TypeError)
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test Case 5
# Divide a matrix by a string (should raise a TypeError)
>>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, '2')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: div must be a number
